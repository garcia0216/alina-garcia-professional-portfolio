# Alina-Garcia Professional-Portfolio


# Description

As a new software developer entering the field I wanted to create a responsive website where I can showcase my work to potential employers and customers.

Using HTML and advanced CSS features, I created a responsive website.

Created clickable links to my contact and work information.

Utilized the features of flexbox and media queries to adjust website to any screen size.

Used semantic elements for search engine optimization and screen readers.

Added alt attributes to describe all of my images.

Utilized universal selector in CSS.
