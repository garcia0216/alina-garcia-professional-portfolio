Alina-Garcia Professional-Portfolio


Description

As a new software developer entering the field I want to create a responsive website where I can showcase my work and have potential employers/customers view my work.

Using HTML and advanced CSS features, I created a website where employers can view my name, picture,contact information and clickable links to view my deployed work.

Utilized the features of flexbox and media queries to adjust website to any screen size.

Used semantic elements for search engine optimization and screen readers.

Added alt attributes to describe all of my images.

Utilized universal selector in CSS.
